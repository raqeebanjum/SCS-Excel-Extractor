Option 1(Local):
    Hosting - windows or linux server(has to be located within company firewall)
    Possibly Apache web server, Maybe a SQLLite database or SQL Server Express for tracking the requests
    Port forwarding for external teams connectivity(don't forget about static IP address)
    Ngroc for creating secure tunnel(if choosing public URL).  


Option 2(Azure):
    Azure Stuff: 
        Hosting: Azure App Service
        Teams communication: Azure Bot Service
        Azure Storage: for storing temp files and the generated documents
    
    Integration Flow:
        User uploads the excel file in teams chat
        Bot receives file through the Azure bot Service
        App does processing
        Generates the proposal and stores it in Azure Storage
        Bot sends document link or atachment back to teams
